I'll put my code in this document for now.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(rentrez)
library(adegenet)
library(ape)
```

# Ort & Pogson 2007 data

Download data from Ort and Pogson from Genbank. Make a vector for accessions listed in paper as EU028349â€“ EU029064.

```{r OrtPogson}

accs <- paste0("EU0",28349:29064)
# this is 716 sequences. Apparently too long for a single entrez query. Will do it as a for loop instead.

for(a in c(1:716)){
  print(paste(a,accs[a]))
  fetched <- entrez_fetch(db = "nuccore", id = accs[a], rettype = "fasta")
  write(fetched, file = "Ort_Pogson_2007.fasta", append = TRUE, sep = "\t")
}

```

Filter out the CO1 data

```{r Filter}

op <- read.FASTA("Ort_Pogson_2007.fasta")
op.co1 <- op[str_detect(names(op), pattern = "cox1")]
names(op.co1) <- str_extract(names(op.co1), pattern = "[A-Z]+[0-9]+[MF]")
write.FASTA(op.co1, file = "Ort_Pogson_CO1.fasta")
```
