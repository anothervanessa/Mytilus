Settings file: migraine.txt

Geographic bin width= 49.3506
Demographic model: IBD 1D
Canonical parameters: 2Nmu 2Nm g
* N stands for number of gene copies, 
    i.e. 2N = 4 x [the number of diploid individuals] *

(!) Few points in upper 10.84 [ln(L) units] range:
	   only 100 points in this range. 
    Only 100 unique coordinates selected for Kriging.

(!) Only 66 points have a predicted likelihood
     in the upper 1.921 [ln(L) units] range.
    (this threshold corresponds to the 0.05 chi-square threshold with 1 df);
    It is advised to compute more points in order to obtain good CIs.
(!)    The highest profile likelihood is extrapolated in the 2Nmu, Nb profile

*** Confidence intervals *** 

95%-coverage confidence interval for 2Nmu : [ 1.984 -- 5.675 ]
95%-coverage confidence interval for 2Nm : [ NA -- 7550 ]
95%-coverage confidence interval for Nb : [ NA -- 1186023 ]
